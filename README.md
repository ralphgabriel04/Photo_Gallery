# CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive photo gallery designed using CSS Flexbox to showcase a collection of cat images. It features a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.

## Features
- **Responsive Flexbox layout:** Utilizes CSS Flexbox to create a dynamic and flexible image grid that adapts to the screen size.
- **Accessibility features:** Each image in the gallery includes descriptive alt text to improve accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.
- **Stylish design:** The gallery header is styled with uppercase text and a colored border accent to enhance visual appeal.
- **Balanced layout:** The `::after` pseudo-element is used to maintain balance in the layout, ensuring consistent alignment of images regardless of the number of items.
- **Optimized images:** Uses the `object-fit` property to maintain aspect ratio without distortion, ensuring all images are displayed consistently.

## How to Use
1. **View the Gallery:** Open the `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the photo gallery.
2. **Add More Images:** To add more images to the gallery, insert additional `<img>` tags within the `.gallery` div. Ensure each image tag includes an `alt` attribute for accessibility.

## Installation
No installation is necessary. Download the project files and open `index.html` with a web browser to run the project.
